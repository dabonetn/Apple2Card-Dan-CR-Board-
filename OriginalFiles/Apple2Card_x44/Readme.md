# WORK IN PROGRESS

Do not order this card at jlpcb unless you know exactly what you are doing

This version of the card works, however the footprint of the crystal is wrong, so you will have to rework out the SMD crystal and install a HC49 version instead (and remove the caps). All the otehr mods for the thru hole version can also apply (pull down on JP2, remove R28.

Otherwise I now have 5 of them that works. IP hasn't been tested yet, it's next.

ALSO do not use the exiting FWUPDATE.SYS it will brick the card, and you will require ISP again to program it. I'm working on an updated fwupdate for the 644P

Please contact Michel Pollet <buserror+git@gmail.com> if you want to discuss this version.
